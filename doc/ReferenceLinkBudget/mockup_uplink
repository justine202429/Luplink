#Mockup uplink used to compare different budget link tools

Parameters :

===
650km circular orbit
146Mhz uplink frequency
10° minimum angle
2045km slant range (calculated by AMSAT)

===
[G/S transmitter system] 
10W
2.79dB cable losses
1.7 dB connectors losses
0.5dB antenna mismatch

===
[Sat receiver system]

0.87dB total in-line losses from antenna to LNA (including 0.1dB from directional coupler and 0.5dB from connectors)
233.15K Antenna/Sky Temp
280K S/C Temp
66.78 LNA Temp
20dB LNA gain
400K 2nd stage Temp

312.4 System Noise Temperature (Ts) : Calculated by AMSAT

[U/L antenna system]
G/S : RHCP Yagi 14.0dBiC 35.0° beamwidth 2 meters
S/C : Linear Monopole 2.15dBiL w/ 156.2° beamwidth

[Pointing Losses]
Estimated pointing error @ G/S : 10°
@S/C : 0° until AMSAT calculation is understood (and then 30°)

[Atmospheric / Polarization losses]

X-polarization : 3dB //Optional for now?
1.1dB (atm gases)
0.4dB (ionosphere @146Mhz)

[Modulation/Demodulation]

AFSK/FM BER 10e-5 required Eb/N0 23.2dB w/ 1.0 dB implementation loss


============================================
For dynamic LB, should use trajectory data from existing nanosat
