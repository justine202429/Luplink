Antenna representations:

AMSAT : monopole, dipole, turnstyle, quadrifilar, patch
linkpredict-python : omnidirectional (includes monopole), main_lobe, measured_antenna (interpolates from a dict of angles:gains) -> equivalent to AMSAT system

Interestingly, AMSAT seem to account for losses directly in the receiver temperature through the feed line coefficient (alpha)

In AMSAT, beware of theta2 angle definition, 0dB loss @ 90°

linkpredict - rx_antenna_pointing_loss disappears when set to 90°

linkpredict - Handling of polarization less advanced than AMSAT : in link._get_polarization_mismatch_loss() "Currently this implementation is rather crude and simply returns 3 dB
        for a polarization mismatch and 0 dB otherwise.". This explains the 3dB difference I found with AMSAT on the total_path_loss of 149 instead of 146. Polarization loss equation is available in AMSAT sheet

linkpredict - requires slant_range already calculated, whereas luplink does it for us
===========================================
Results : 

AMSAT : 17.6dB link margin w/ Eb/N0 method (1200bps desired) | 21.2dB w/ SNR computation (5kHz bandwidth (enough?))

Comparing w/ link-predict :


For now, different ways to take noise temperature into account for AMSAT (more detailed) and link-predict
