# Luplink

![Luplink integrated inside JSatorb](./luplink.gif)

This workspace contains two projects :
  - ngx-luplink, the library containing modules, components & services of luplink (see [ngx-luplink's README.md](./projects/ngx-luplink/README.md) for more information)
  - luplink-app, the app that bootstraps ngx-luplink for standalone use or development of the library

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.14.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project ngx-luplink` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project ngx-luplink`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project ngx-luplink` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build ngx-luplink` to build the project in production mode. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build ngx-luplink`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ngx-luplink` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test ngx-luplink` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
